# ForASG
Completion of the first half of a technical test.

This is the beginning of the design of a Roulette system.

The project requires Maven ~3.0.x be installed. The project is also built on a Linux platform using the openjdk-9-jdk package, so some POM dependency version numbers might need to be 'tweaked' on non-Unix systems.

As this is not intended to ever be a finished project, one need only the command:
```
mvn test -q
```
Which will run the appropriate test scripts.
